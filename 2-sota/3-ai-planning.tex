\subsection{STRIPS}\label{subsec:STRIPS}
In STRIPS a closed-world assumption is used, i.e. any conditions that are not mentioned in a state are assumed to be false.

Different types of planning: \cite{ROSplanAAAI17tutorial}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Classical planning
    \item Optimisation: minimise or maximise a given cost function
    \item Temporal planning: actions have a certain duration, to address concurrency, synchronisation, time dependent effects.
    \item Planning with preferences: prefer hard goals over soft goals.
    \item Conditional planning: actions can perform observations, plan contains branches
\end{itemize}
