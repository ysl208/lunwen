In this section we focus on Automated Planning.
We present the theoretical definitions and representations (\sect{subsec:Classical planning problem}), the standard encoding language PDDL (\sect{subsec:PDDL}), and knowledge engineering tools for creating planning domains (\sect{subsec:Knowledge Engineering}).
%, and situate our thesis in relation to these approaches.
