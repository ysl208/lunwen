In this chapter we give a brief overview on Automated Planning and its main concepts.
We first present the theoretical definitions (\sect{subsec:Classical planning problem}) and the standard encoding language used (\sect{subsec:PDDL}).
We then discuss common techniques for planning (\sect{subsec:Planners}) and knowledge engineering tools for modelling planning domains (\sect{subsec:Knowledge Engineering}).
We conclude this chapter by discussing relations to this thesis (\sect{subsec:APdiscussions}).
