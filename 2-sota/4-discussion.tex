\section{Discussion and relation to present work}
- what is wrong with current SotA?
Manual programming: requires programming time and effort to debug/test
automatic programming: learning systems (NN) not only requires large amount of training data but data must be relevant for current situation
Learning by Exploration: takes time for the robot to explore environment and collect all necessary data
Learning by Watching: requires optimal \& minimal set of demonstration data 
- what is feasible is that a human operator is available
- what problem are we addressing?
