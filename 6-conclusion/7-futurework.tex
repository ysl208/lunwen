\section{Future Work}
Future work to continue the implementation should address the following improvements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrate an automated planner with ROS.
\item Use statistical methods for the generalisation of learned trajectories.
\item Implement a functionality to learn the colours and shapes to detect new objects.
\item Use of multiple grippers to enable the grasping of different objects.
\item Completing the user interface with options to define the planning domain, predicates, and problems.
\item Use of multiple cameras to enable the automatic recognition of all predicates.
\item Use of multiple sensors to track the state of the world.
\item Implement a functionality that compares newly created actions with already existing actions to avoid redundancies.
\end{itemize}
