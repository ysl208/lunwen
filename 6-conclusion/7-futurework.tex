\section{On-going and Future work}
The main focus for the remainder of the thesis is a complete implementation of the end-to-end framework and a graphical interface to allow easy interaction with the robot. In particular, the work for the remaining thesis duration will include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete user interface with options to modify planning domain, predicates, and define new problems.
\item Integrate automated planner using PDDL4Jrospy.
\item Use of multiple grippers to enable the grasping of different objects.
\item Complete integration of end-to-end system including action execution of newly taught actions.
\item User acceptance studies of the completed end-to-end system.
\item Validation and improvement of programming process and flow.
\end{itemize}

Possible extensions, which are out of scope of this thesis, but will be included if time permits, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use statistical methods for the generalisation of learned trajectories.
	\item Functionality to learn the colours and shapes of new object types.
	\item Use of multiple sensors to track the state of the world.
	\item Use of multiple cameras to enable the automatic recognition of all predicates.
	\item Functionality that compares newly created actions with already existing actions to avoid redundancies.
\end{itemize}
