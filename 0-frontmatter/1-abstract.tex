\noindent The increasing presence of robots in industries has not gone unnoticed in recent years. Large industrial players have incorporated them into their production lines, but smaller companies hesitate, due to high initial costs and the lack of programming expertise. In this thesis we introduce a framework that combines two disciplines, Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning, to allow users without programming knowledge to program a robot. 
The user constructs the robot's knowledge base by teaching it actions, together with their semantic meaning, and enables the robot to reason about them. We teach the robot a goal-oriented behaviour by using automated planning techniques, and thereby make use of the standard encoding language for classical planning (PDDL).
We evaluated our approach in terms of experiments using a Baxter Research Robot and showed that users without any programming experience can easily adopt this method.
