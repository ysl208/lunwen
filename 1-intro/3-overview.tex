\section{Document organization}
This thesis is organised as follows. 

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Sota}} gives an overview of the state of the art in Robot Programming.

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Sota-PbD} and \chapt{chap:Sota-AP}} cover definitions and state of the art of Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning respectively.

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Contribution}} presents our proposed solution as as Robot Programming Framework for End-Users.

%\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Implementation}} details our achieved implementation of the framework. 

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Evaluation}} presents preliminary results in terms of qualitative experiments for evaluating our framework. We present experimental findings on user acceptance and issues encountered when introduced to the AI planning concepts.

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:OrganisingTasks}} presents the work on shelf organising tasks for simultaneous end-user programming of goals and actions.

\paragraph{\chapt{chap:Conclusion}} concludes our work and discusses possibilities for future implementations of the framework.
