\section{Document organization}
This thesis is organised into two parts:
%An overview of the chapters can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:chapter-overview}.

The first part (\ref{part1}) provides a literature review of state of the art techniques in robot programming ({\chapt{chap:Sota}}), followed by an overview of Automated Planning ({\chapt{chap:Sota-AP}}).

The second part (\ref{part2}) presents our contributions involving iRoPro, the proposed end-user robot programming framework ({\chapt{chap:Contribution}}). 
We first conduct qualitative experiments and present experimental findings on user acceptance and issues encountered when introduced to Automated Planning concepts ({\chapt{chap:Pre-Experiments}}).
We then focus on evaluating our goal-oriented end-user robot programming approach and present our work on shelf organising tasks to simultaneous program goals and actions by demonstration ({\chapt{chap:OrganisingTasks}}).
Our main contribution is an end-to-end system implementation of iRoPro. We present details on the implementation and the system and user evaluation in {\chapt{chap:Implementation}}.

Finally, we conclude this thesis in {\chapt{chap:Conclusion}} and discuss possibilities for future work and research.
