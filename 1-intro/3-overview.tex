\section{Document organization}
This thesis is organised as follows. 
%An overview of the chapters can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:chapter-overview}.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota}} provides a literature review of state of the art Robot Programming techniques, followed by a brief overview of Automated Planning (\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota-AP}}).

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Contribution}} presents our proposed solution as End-User Robot Programming Framework.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Pre-Experiments}} presents preliminary results in terms of qualitative experiments for evaluating our framework. We present experimental findings on user acceptance and issues encountered when introduced to the AI planning concepts.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:OrganisingTasks}} presents our work on shelf organising tasks for simultaneous end-user programming of goals and actions where we demonstrate that PbD is a good means for end-user programming.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Implementation}} presents iRoPro and details the implementation of the proposed framework. 

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Evaluation}} presents our evaluation in terms of system evaluation and user experiments based on benchmark tasks.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Conclusion}} concludes our work and discusses possibilities for future implementations of the framework.
