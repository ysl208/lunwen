\section{Document organization}
This thesis is organised into two parts:
%An overview of the chapters can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:chapter-overview}.

The first part (\ref{part1}) provides a literature review of state of the art techniques in robot programming (\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota}}), followed by an overview of Automated Planning (\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota-AP}}).

The second part (\ref{part2}) presents our contributions involving iRoPro, the proposed end-user robot programming framework. %\textbf{\chapt{chap:Contribution}}. 
We first conduct qualitative experiments and present experimental findings on user acceptance and issues encountered when introduced to the AI planning concepts (\textbf{\chapt{chap:Pre-Experiments}}).
We then focus on evaluating our goal-oriented end-user robot programming approach (\textbf{\chapt{chap:OrganisingTasks}}) and present our work on shelf organising tasks to simultaneous program goals and actions by demonstration.
Our main contribution is an end-to-end system implementation of iRoPro, for which we present details on the implementation and the system evaluation in \textbf{\chapt{chap:Implementation}}.
Finally, we conclude this thesis in \textbf{\chapt{chap:Conclusion}} and discuss possibilities for future implementations of the framework.
