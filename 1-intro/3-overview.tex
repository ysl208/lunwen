\section{Document organization}
This thesis is organised as follows. 
An overview of the chapters can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:chapter-overview}.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota}} gives an overview of the state of the art in Robot Programming.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Sota-PbD} and \chapt{chap:Sota-AP}} cover definitions and state of the art of Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning respectively.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Contribution}} presents our proposed solution as End-User Robot Programming Framework.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Pre-Experiments}} presents preliminary results in terms of qualitative experiments for evaluating our framework. We present experimental findings on user acceptance and issues encountered when introduced to the AI planning concepts.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Implementation}} presents iRoPro and details the implementation of the proposed framework. 

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Evaluation}} presents our evaluation in terms of system evaluation and user experiments based on benchmark tasks.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:OrganisingTasks}} presents the work on shelf organising tasks for simultaneous end-user programming of goals and actions.

\textbf{\chapt{chap:Conclusion}} concludes our work and discusses possibilities for future implementations of the framework.
